**Rotating Navigation**

A website that rotates to show the navigation bar: Click on the hamburger menu and the whole content rotates to show the nav bar at the bottom of the page. If you click again it rotates back.

The JavaScript is very simple: add an EventListener and add and remove a class on click.
The CSS is a bit more challenging.

This is the 3rd project from Brad Traversy's Udemy Course "50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript".
